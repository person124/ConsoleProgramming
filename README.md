# Tactical Knockout

For one of my final classes (_Console Programming_) here at Champlain we are tasked with creating something preferably game related for something that _isn't_ a pc. So for my project I have chosen to move forward with a framework for a tactical turn based game where units have special abilities. I have chosen to write the game in LUA using [Love2D](https://love2d.org/ "Love2D Homepage") as a game creation framework.

I am using a specific version of Love2D: *0.10.2*

Now, the reason why I said I am making a game framework and not a game is most of the focus of my work for the course will be to make the framework to allow easy creation of entities and maps; however that is _not_ saying I'm not making a game. It is also a course requirement to have a game, so my solution is to use the framework I am making to create a short game with maybe one or two basic-ish levels. With the point of each level to show off the framework more then anything else.

The rest of this readme will be a table showcasing a schedule that I came up with just before the fourth week of work on the project; this is also the first week I actually started to work on the project. The schedule is something that I set myself, and can deviate from, but when I wrote it I imagined that it was the best course of action at the time.
