# Currently Untitled Project

For one of my final classes (_Console Programming_) here at champlain we are tasked with creating something prefferability game related for something that _isn't_ a pc. So for my project I have chosen to move forward with a framework for a tactical turn based game where units have special abilities; oh, and its for mobile. I have chosen to write the game in LUA using [Love2D](https://love2d.org/ "Love2D Homepage") as a game creation framework.

Now, the reason why I said I am making a game framework and not a game is most of the focus of my work for the course will be to make the framework to allow easy creation of entities and maps, however that is _not_ saying I'm not making a game. It is also a course requirement to have a game, so my solution is to use the framework I am making to create a short game with maybe one or two basicish levels. With the point of each level to show off the framework more then anything else.

The rest of this readme will be a table showcase a schedule that I came up with just before the fourth week of work on the project started, as well as just before I _started_ work on the project. The schedule is something that I set myself, and can deviate from, but when I wrote it I imagined that it was the best course of action at the time.
